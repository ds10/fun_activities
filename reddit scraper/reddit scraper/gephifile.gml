    posttext "So I work at Pappadeaux in Denver and pretty much half your squad rolled in for lunch (12-2). 

Most guys got Tuna or Salmon, but Richard Sherman got our 40$ deluxe fried fish combo &amp; some John Lynch got large king crab legs. 

Just thought Id share this valuable scouting report with yall

Edit: also Sherman subbed out chicken tenderloins for extra Crawfish, so Id say hes gonna get about 12 ints this year"

    title "Jets fan in Denver with some intel!"
    posttext "So I work at Pappadeaux in Denver and pretty much half your squad rolled in for lunch (12-2). 

Most guys got Tuna or Salmon, but Richard Sherman got our 40$ deluxe fried fish combo &amp; some John Lynch got large king crab legs. 

Just thought Id share this valuable scouting report with yall

Edit: also Sherman subbed out chicken tenderloins for extra Crawfish, so Id say hes gonna get about 12 ints this year"
